## Predicting the Ground State Properties of Undiscovered Nuclei and Exploring the Uncharted Border of Nuclear Landscape ##

With entering the new era of new generation radioactive-ion beam facilities, the new facilities allow us to resolve previously challenging experiments in discovering new isotopes, in revealing the important physics related to these exotic nuclei far from the β-stability valley, and in deepening our understanding of the origins and evolutions of the chemical elements in the Universe. These facilities are constructed at but not limited to the Second Generation System On-Line Production of Radioactive Ions ([SPIRAL2](https://www.ganil-spiral2.eu/)) at GANIL in France, the Radioactive Ion Beam Factory ([RIBF](https://www.riken.jp/en/collab/resources/ribf/)) at RIKEN in Japan, the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams ([FRIB](https://frib.msu.edu/)) in the US, the Advanced Rare Isotope Laboratory ([ARIEL](https://www.triumf.ca/ariel-advanced-rare-isotope-laboratory/)) in Canada, the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research ([FAIR](https://fair-center.eu/)) in Germany, the Rare Isotope Accelerator complex for Online Experiments ([RAON](https://risp.ibs.re.kr/html/risp_en/)) in Korea, and the Heavy-Ion Accelerator Facility ([HIAF](https://hiaf.impcas.ac.cn/hiaf_en/public/)) in China. 

Exotic nuclei that potentially exhibit new phenomena provide testing ground for our understanding of quantum many-body system. Up to now, the existence of about 2500 nuclides have been experimentally proven. New facilities are very promising in discovering more exotic nuclei and in unraveling the phenomena that we have never seen before. For confirming the existence of new isotopes and the limit of an isotopic chain, world-wide scientists need to determine the nuclear masses, radii, half-lives of these newly discovered isotopes. Nevertheless, scientists are restricted by the very constrained resources in performing experiments, and thus they have to prioritize which new isotopes are possible to be discovered or even to be remeasured in high precision. Therefore, a set of reliable theoretical predictions of the characteristics (physics properties) of new isotopes serves as a forefront guideline for experimentalists to explore the uncharted nuclear landscape. Measuring the last bound nuclei of isotopic chains not only examines the up-to-date nuclear theory, but also advances our understanding of the extent of nucleosyntheses (syntheses of chemical elements) at the extreme astrophysical environment during neutron star mergers, core-collapsed supernovae, and X-ray bursts. Also, matching theoretical predictions and experimental findings could be exciting for us to cross check our theoretical models. 
 
Recently, we collaborated with Peter Ring, professor emeritus of Technische Universität München, in using the covariant density functional theory to predict the existence and properties of these exotic nuclei. The covariant density functional theory is capable in describing the interactions among nucleons in the nuclear medium. The nucleon-nucleon interactions can be expressed in the form of either point-coupling interaction (assuming nucleons as point-like particles interacting with one another) or meson-exchange interaction (assuming nucleons as some constituents communicating with one another via passing the messengers – mesons). We plugged in one of these interactions to the Relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov approach to systematically explore the ground state properties of all isotopic chains from oxygen to darmstadtium. These properties consist of the binding energies, one-neutron and two-neutron separation energies, root-mean-square radii of matter, of neutron, of proton and of charge distribution, Fermi surfaces, ground-state spins and parities. Based on these ground state properties of nuclei, we explored the drip lines of neutron and proton, halo phenomena, and new magic numbers. Our result provides corresponding guidance for future experiments and theoretical research in nuclear physics.
